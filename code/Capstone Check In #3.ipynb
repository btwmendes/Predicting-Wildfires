I've made some preliminary graphs that show the number of wildfires in each state, the causes of wildfires, day of week, etc. I'm working on learning plotyly so I can make choropleth graphs, which I think will add a lot to the EDA and throughout the analysis. It should be easier to grasp wildfires if you can see where they are located. I also need to dig into time based graphs. My theory is that there is a fire season. \n"
